A game of dices. Roll the dices to collect different scores between low = all dices with value 3 and under are counted, and from 4 to 12. To collect points color the dices that together makes up the score of chosen round, or multiple of chosen round. If one group color does not have a score of chosen round or multiple of chosen round, the score are not added. You get 3 chances to roll the dices, and coloring any dice locks specific dice from rolling.
